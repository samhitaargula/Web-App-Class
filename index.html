                <p>Hi! I am a dev. This is my site for the Web Application Foundations class.
                    I have experience with web development by studying it in undergrad
                    and also working as a web development intern where I built sites like a resume 
                    portfolio blog. I know the basics of HTML, CSS and JS. I like making sites!
